Netuitive Remote Collector JDBC Adapter
=======================================

The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) Adapter was created to allow the Netuitive Remote Collector to interface with Java. The Remote Collector allows a source instance to collect data and send the data to a target remote instance (e.g., [Netuitive](https://www.netuitive.com)).

For more information on the Remote Collector, contact Netuitive support at [support@netuitive.com](mailto:support@netuitive.com).
